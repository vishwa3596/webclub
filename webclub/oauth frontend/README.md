some point i would like to mention about this project are :-
i have implemented this oauth through Flask Dance which is a library of the Flask framework in 
python and in frontend i have used Reactjs( framework of Javascript)

i have made this project to the best that i can do 

it is requested to use this app in incognito mode of the browser.

how to start the project:-
first of all install requirement.txt file from oauth backend.
pip install -r requirements.txt for python 2.x
pip3 install -r requirements.txt for python 3.x
then open the frontend app and type in terminal -> npm install.
                     then start the server with -> npm start

It is likely to face internal server error i have tried myself alot to improve this but 
due to changing version of Flask dance every post is not updated so pls when u find the internel server error 
do click the link again.

CORS error is also evident in this project of mine. As you can see i have made 2 approach to 
access the oauth via AJAX and via ANCHOR tag in ajax method i was continously getting the 
CORS policy error even after passing the request via a proxy like-proxy='https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com'
but it was not of use. Later i found on Stack-overflow that there might be some error in the api.

In regards of styling i have maintained a minimilistic styling.

this is my 1st of 3 projects i have done for web club.
Thank you.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
