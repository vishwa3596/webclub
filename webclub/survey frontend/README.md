I would like to share few details about my project:-

TOOLS and library that i have used-
i have created this project with the help of React(framework of javascript) and Flask(framework of python)
with database in SqlAlchemy which comes in Flask I have also used ajax method(AXIOS) for 
communicating with the backend and dynamically fetching data from the database.I have also used
canvas.js for creating the graph for showing the survey result.I have also used React BootStrap 
for some part of design. I have also used POSTMAN for api testing(It is a tool for api testing). 

I have made the UI interactive as possible and at the same time kept it minimilistic.

How to start this project after downloading.
after downloading the project run -> npm install
                after that        -> npm start
install the dependencies mentioned in the requirement.txt file (pip install -r requirements.txt) for python 2 and (pip3 install -r requirements.txt) for python 3.x                
at the same time run the backend with -> python app.py                

this is a simple project i have created with all my efforts. There is a lot of scope of improvement
There might be some flaws in the project. 

this is the 3rd project i have submitted out of my 3 projects done for web club. 
Thank YOU


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
